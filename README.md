ELNgitsta
======

> **gitsta theme is no longer maintained. See [here](https://nehalist.io/not-maintaining-my-wordpress-theme-gitsta-anymore/).**

This is a fork of gitsta that has been repurposed for use in Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs). In the Centre for Mechanochemical Cell Biology at Warwick we run a multi-site WordPress install to power ELNs for several research labs. This theme is served up for the ELNs of all labs.

> Now updated to use Gutenberg blocks

For more information on our use of ELNs see the links [below](#links)
